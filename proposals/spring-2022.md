## Stack:
Telescope is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the
[actix](https://actix.rs/) framework and the [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
templating engine. We also use [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS and 
a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API as the backend. 

## Goals
This Spring, my goals for Telescope are to add documentation and make the project more self sustaining, and basic support for RCOS projects. I've listed additional features, but going off of the pace of Telescope so far, the timeline is optimistic.
